<h1>The Best Movies watched by Devansh Desai in 2024</h1>
<h2>Top 3 movies that I watched in 2024</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. The social network</h3>
<p>
Mark Zuckerberg has been my inspiration for as long as  I could remember.<br />
A Millionaire in his 20s and A BILLIONAIRE, A top 5 richest person on earth at the age of 40 is no joke and That is the reason I want to be like him.<br />
I loved how his character was shown to be the introvert coder/programmer who gained popularity and billions of dollars at his own terms.<br />
I really wish to be the next Mark Zuckerberg.<br />

<h3>2. Dune/Dune 2</h3>
<p>
Great direction, storyline, performance by the actors and the action is out of this world.
</p>
<h3>3. The Founder</h3>
<p>
I am yet to watch this movie but, just by watching the trailer I have came to know that this is going to be in my top 3 list 
because it's going to teach me the methods of one of the biggest bussiness minds of all time, and I hope that it helps me.
